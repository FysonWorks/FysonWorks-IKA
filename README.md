# IKA – FysonWorks IDE

IKA is a modern, lightweight code editor developed by Caleb (FysonWorks).  
It includes Python and HTML editing, a live preview system, chunk-based editing, a snippet manager, and a minimal dark interface.

## Features

### Modern Dark UI
IKA uses a custom dark interface designed for clarity and focus.

### Python and HTML Support
The editor switches between Python and HTML modes.  
HTML mode includes a live preview panel.

### Live HTML Preview
The preview updates automatically as you type, allowing instant visual feedback.

### Chunk Editor
Code can be split into multiple "chunks" which can be individually edited and then stitched together into a full script.

### Snippet Manager
Users can select code, save it as a named snippet, and reinsert it anywhere later.

### Image Manager
A separate image window allows adding and previewing images for use in projects.

### Integrated Output Console
Python scripts can be run directly inside IKA, with output displayed in the built-in console.

### Custom Application Branding
IKA uses a custom icon and a GitHub banner created specifically for the project.
