IKA – How I Made It
--------------------

IKA began as a custom idea to create my own coding environment. 
I wanted something modern, dark-themed, and simple.
Below is the full process of how I created the IKA IDE.

1. Concept & Planning
   - I wanted an editor that wasn’t just another code editor.
   - Features I chose:
       • Dark UI
       • Python & HTML support
       • Live HTML preview
       • Chunk-based editing system
       • Snippet manager
       • Image manager
   - I also planned a custom “I” logo with purple neon glow.

2. Designing the UI
   - Used Python with Tkinter to build the main window.
   - Added:
       • Menu bar (File, Edit, Tools, etc.)
       • Editor panel
       • Output console
       • Live HTML preview panel
   - Styled it with dark colors (#111, #1c1c1c, #222, #333)
   - Added line numbers, scrolling, and resizing.

3. Custom Features
   - Snippets:
       • Highlight text → Add as snippet → Reuse later
   - Chunks:
       • Create multiple code chunks and stitch them together
   - HTML Preview:
       • Auto-refreshes when typing HTML
   - Image Manager:
       • Opens a window to store and use images inside projects

4. Branding & Icon Creation
   - Created a custom purple glowing "I" icon based on a sketch.
   - Made a banner for GitHub inside `.github/assets/`.
   - Generated a 1024px PNG, then converted to .ICO for Windows.

5. Building the EXE
   - Wrote a custom auto-builder script (build_ika.py - Find in build tools folder)
   - The script:
       • Finds Downloads folder
       • Converts ioc.png → Ika.ico
       • Runs PyInstaller to make IKA.exe
   - Final EXE is fully standalone:
       • Does not need Python installed
       • Works on any Windows computer

6. GitHub Setup
   - Added banner, icon, README.md
   - Documented features, build instructions, and project structure.
   - Uploaded assets into `.github/assets/`
   - README automatically loads banner at top.

7. Result
   - IKA is a modern, dark, lightweight IDE made entirely with Python.
   - It supports multiple languages, snippets, chunks, preview tools, and more.
   - Fully packaged into a Windows EXE with custom branding.
